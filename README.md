# Shopping cart DOM project

Link to the project: https://gameshippers.netlify.app

22/07/2021: Items can be added to the cart. 

Features that are going to be added in the website are:
1. Alphabetic searching
2. Voice operated add shop system
3. Contact system

Fixes to be done:
1. The desired font doesn't work on a firefox browser, not sure why yet.
2. The responsiveness is not there and needs to be fixed.
